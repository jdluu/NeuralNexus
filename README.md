## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jdluu/NeuralNexus.git
cd NeuralNexus
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
# On Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate
# On Unix or MacOS
source .venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
GLHF_API_KEY=your_glhf_api_key_here
BRAVE_API_KEY=your_brave_api_key_here
LLM_MODEL=hf:meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct
```

## Usage

Run the Streamlit web interface:

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_ui.py
```

The interface will guide you through:

1. Selecting the most appropriate AI role for your task
2. Entering your query or request
3. Viewing the AI's response with relevant sources and information
